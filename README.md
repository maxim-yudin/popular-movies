# Popular Movies
This is my first finished project in Udacity's Android Developer Nanodegree. The purpose of this project was to learn and practice Android Fundamentals (activities, fragments, databases, content providers, UI building, working with some movie APIs, using some libraries like Retrofit and Picasso etc).
